Character Creation and Management.

Debug Module : Admin Only

    Direct access to twine stories hidden inside various tiles in the main view.
    Direct access to puzzles etc.
    Direct Access to experimental Works in progress

<h3>Communication Modules:</h3>

Default Modules:
![Wavy Lines](https://github.com/EMC23/JiGS/blob/master/images/image06.png)

WavyLines is the Universe in action. All people receive numerous ESP messages from the people and world around them. Some messages are esoteric and obscure others are simple messages. Typical Messages would be “John increased one level” “John has converted to buddhism” “ A zombie horde attacks the outer villages.”

Players can enter messages here.

At one point this also collected spam, which had some interesting outcomes. This might be investigated again to re-introduce.

Messenger Module:
This is a direct line between the player and the world. Typical messages would be “You picked up the rock”, “You increased one level”

![WMessenger](https://github.com/EMC23/JiGS/blob/master/images/image06.png)

<h3>Main View Option One</h3>

Uses point and click with pathfinder to move your player to tile(on hold).
Tiles 32 *32 px

Maps 18 * 14 tiles
Grid: User Defined

<h3>Main View Option Two</h3>

Uses cursor or button presses( see compass button) to move one tile at a time .  
Tiles 50 *50px

Map 8*8 tiles
Grid = 4*4 maps or 3*3 maps or 2*2 maps etc

![8X8 tiles](https://github.com/EMC23/JiGS/blob/master/images/image04.png)

<h3>Character Creation</h3> [On hold]

![Character Creation ](https://github.com/EMC23/JiGS/blob/master/images/image08.png)

In the main views , players see themselves represented by webstyle  avatars as opposed to game style representations. This allows players to upload their own images. The conflict of styles creates part of the cut’paste aesthetic.
Extended Character selection is on hold until third party plugin system is complete to allow for more varied character selection systems.

Daz3d might be a good candidate for this.

<h3>Profile Page</h3>

Currently using Joomla Community Builder with customised plugins for game stats.This suits minimum requirements for both again and game at present. Basic plugins can be created with minimum coding skills via the CB gui.Screenshot from 2014-10-19 14:19:57.png

<h3>Buildings & Economics</h3>

All buildings contain an info module on the top left

All player owned buildings contain a control panel on the top right.
All government building contain a movie poster on the right
Each building type contains a primary module on the bottom.
The control panel allows the player assign workforce to primary, defence and distribution systems.
The control panel allows the player assign energy batteries to buildings system as a whole
The control panels allows the player to prioritise Quantity, quality and cost in terms of energy and credits.
The primary systems allows the player to control the buildings primary system, farming, factory and mining functions. A building can upgrade or increase it’s primary systems depending on skills etc.
for example a farm may have 1- 8 fields each growing different crops.
Or a factory may have 1-8 conveyor belts each building different objects,
Each additional primary system is accessed via tabs and is identical in layout.




<h3>Banks, Terminals, Banks and hacking</h3>
Players and NPCs can hack and be hacked, causing grief, stealing bank account percentages and spreading viruses. There are three global banks each with their own interest rates ,security packages and insurance deals.

<h3>Factories</h3>
Screenshot from 2014-10-19 14:27:09.png

<h3>Guilds, Groups, Crime Families, Gangs, Secret Societies and Factions</h3>

You are always part of a group, your group is part of one of three factions. Various stats affect faction and group standing (all other names are group synonyms) and vice versa.
Actions within twine stories affect group and faction standings.
You can change groups, but only to a group of the same faction.

<h3>Exploration</h3>

Exploration (via character development) is the primary core loop of the virtual world. New Maps, Scenarios including time travel to familiar places will be added to the system on a monthly basis. ALternate realities, drug induced trips etc will play a part in the exploration narrative.
Maps are creating using the open source Tiled Mapeditor.org. and imported to the systom using json files.
Portals are a heavily used device in both the game mechanics and the overarching metastory.
Portals need to be discovered in the real before they can be accessed via the portal network.
Technically all portal are one way but may exist in pairs.
Many of the portals are discovered via Twine stories.

</h3>Banks and Hacking</h3>

Players and NPCs can hack and be hacked, causing grief, stealing bank account percentages and spreading viruses. There are three global banks each with their own interest rates ,security packages and insurance deals.

<h3>NPCs, Mobs, Hobbits(workforce)</h3>

NPCS should be as deeply developed as possible. They should be as indistinguishable from players as possible in terms of fighting acquisitions and political power.
Ai in terms of dialogue is not necessary tho’ can be investigated as a 3rd party plugin.
Mobs include borgs, orcs, goblins, zombies of different classes. Largely indistinguishable from each other
 Workforce: 1 is born every minute in realtime. It will align itself to a building owned by a member of one of the 3 factions. Likelihood of a players building being chosen is a result of various stats including building efficiency, hobbit magic etc.
hobbits have a lifespan as defined by the gamemaster which can be altered via dynamic forces.

<h3>Inventory</h3>

BackPack: Currently limited to 12 objects. Weight and Size are not taken in consideration as yet.

Warehouses:Crops, Mass quantities of objects for sale or transport. (On Hold)

Apartment: Limited to 100 objects , cannot be lost, unless AWOL limit has be exceeded (if configured)

<h3>Storylines-Hypertext  </h3>

Several arcs spanning the rise of the internet from bbs to global hive minds, across numerous dimensions.
Split into hypertexts which can be accessed via content management system based on faction, stats , player level and external events such as NPC actions.
Javascript animations, cut scenes and minigames breakdown the difference between the game and the narrative.
Depreciation, Rent Taxation, Quality Reduction, Depletion and Balance.
Various cron jobs are set on regular intervals to reduce objects quality and deduct building rent. Failure to pay rent results in removal of acquisition.
Not playing for a period of  three months should result in total non effect of player. All buildings should be repossessed , objects decline in quality etc.
